## 1. Real Estate Valuation Analysis [Python • StatsModels] 🏠

🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/hien-linda-le/real-estate-analysis.git)

✍️ Description: A full statistical analysis exploring how structural and locational factors influence housing prices in a Taiwan city. This project uses Python, Pandas, StatsModels, and Seaborn to uncover linear, interaction-based, and nonlinear effects behind real estate valuation.

**Correlation & Exploratory Analysis:** Conducted EDA to understand variable relationships. Key findings include:

- Strong negative correlation between distance to MRT and price.

- Positive association between nearby convenience stores and higher prices.

- Older homes tend to be priced lower.

**Regression Modeling:** Developed multiple OLS regression models to compare predictive performance and interpret effects:

- Simple Linear Regression: price ~ distanceMRT

- Multiple Regression: price ~ age + convstore + year

- Interaction Model: distanceMRT × convstore

- Polynomial Model: non-linear distance effects using squared and cubic terms.
  Included diagnostic checks for heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and residual distribution.

**Key Insights:**

- Homes closer to MRT stations consistently hold higher value.

- Convenience store count amplifies pricing, potentially capturing neighbourhood accessibility.

- Interaction effects show MRT distance matters more in areas with fewer stores.

- Polynomial modeling reveals pricing declines with MRT distance at a non-linear rate.

🔎 Showcases skills in statistical reasoning, data preprocessing, OLS modeling, interaction term analysis, model diagnostics, and interpreting real-world economic relationships.
